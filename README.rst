Timestamp Versioned Dictionary Interview Question
=================================================

There are two classes of the versioned dictionary one that uses a linear search of values stored at a given key an another that uses a n log(n) binary search of the stored values for a given key.

Known issues
----------------------------------
Due to clock sensitivity it is possible to have a value stored out of sequence.::

   traveler.put('key', value1)
   traveler.put('key', value2)

while the order that the values 1 and 2 entered are guaranteed, the timestamps used to select them is generated by pythons time.time() which does not have strong order guarantees. In order to solve this we would need to use some variation on a vector clock or even a use uuid. This would obviously change the API quite a bit, so I put it off.

You will notice that the unit test use a small sleep to avoid this issue.
